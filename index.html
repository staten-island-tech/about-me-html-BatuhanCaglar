    <h1> My name is Batu </h1>  
    <h4>
        <p> I attend Staten Island Technical Highschool and I hope to explore CS </p> 
        <p> More specifically, I'm a freshman that graduated from I.S. 75 as the Arista Leader</p>
        <p> My cultural background is being of Turkish descent and of course the food and tradition that originates from it</p>
        <p> Due to being a first-gentaration Turkish-American, most of my relatives are still living in Turkey, so I often take my vacations in the Mediterranean region</p>
        <p> Moreover, I live with my parents and my twin sister, who attends Wagner Highschool</p>
        <p> I also have four pet parrots, courtesy of my sister</p>
